# CIV102 Matboard Bridge Design & Construction Project
 
This repository is home to all the MATLAB code used to calculate 15+ different failure loads and modes of a bridge my two teammates and I designed and built. The MATLAB code is written using functional programming, and visualizes the maximum failure load at any point along the 1.25m bridge due to forces caused by both shear and bending moments. The final constructed bridge withstood over 1200 N in loading. Check out some of the process images below!
